This keyboard aims to serve all Nigerian languages, not just Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, using the standard characters normally recommended for each script.

Please write to keyboards@m.rowbory.co.uk if you need letters that are not provided here.

On touch, press and hold for alternate characters similar to the letter you press.
Q and space have several combining letters so you can type o then hold on Q to choose the underline or underdot or an accent above.
On a computer with physical keyboard use the semicolon, back tick (`) and tilde (~) keys to generate variations.
